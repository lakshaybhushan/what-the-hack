## Built With

- Next.js 14
- Tailwind CSS
- Hono
- Cloudflare Workers
- Vercel

## Points to Note

- This project is a very basic implementation of the Cloudflare Workers AI service. The AI service is still in beta (especially modals that I'm using `Meta's Llama 3`[text generation] & `Dreamshaper`[image generation]) and may not be as accurate as expected. The project is intended to showcase the capabilities of the service and may not be suitable for production use.

- If you encounter any issues with the project, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request. I would be happy to help you out!.

This project was possible thanks to an awesome dev [Dhravya Shah](https://github.com/Dhravya) who built the early implementation of this project on his first live stream. You can check out the stream [here](https://www.youtube.com/live/tWCRWo02F-0?si=RMcSFJGB2QVIZ19r). I built upon his work and added a few more features to the project. Thanks, Dhravya! ðŸš€
